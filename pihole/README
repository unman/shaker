This is Pi-hole.
It blocks advertisements and internet trackers by providing a DNS sinkhole.

The package will create a new standalone qube, sys-pihole.
It is a drop in replacement for sys-firewall.
Sys-pihole is attached to sys-net.
If you have sys-firewall as the default netvm, this will be changed to sys-pihole.
sys-firewall will *not* be removed, so you can still use it for some qubes if you want.
To use sys-pihole simply change the netvm.
If you want to change all your qubes from sys-firewall to sys-pihole, a script is provided:
Run `sudo /srv/salt/pihole/change_netvm.sh` .

 If you want to use Tor, then you should reconfigure your system like this:
 qubes -> sys-pihole -> Tor-gateway -> sys-firewall -> sys-net

 You can clone sys-pihole, and use each in different places:
 qubes -> sys-pihole -> sys-net
 qubes -> sys-pihole -> Tor-gateway -> sys-firewall -> sys-net
 You will have to adjust the network settings for eth0 in the clone.

Pi-hole will be installed with these default settings:
 The DNS provider is Quad9 (filtered, DNSSEC)
 StevenBlack's Unified Hosts List is included
 The web interface is availble at http://localhost/admin
 Query logging is enabled to show everything.

You can change these settings by logging in to the admin interface at http://localhost/admin
The default Admin Webpage login password is UpSNQsy4
You should change this on first use, by running:
`pihole -a -p`


The implementation is based on work by Patrizio Tufarolo, 
(https://blog.tufarolo.eu/how-to-configure-pihole-in-qubesos-proxyvm/ ), 
and updated for Qubes 4.2

  for i in `qvm-ls -O NAME,NETVM | awk '/ sys-firewall/{ print $1 }'`; do qvm-prefs $i netvm sys-pihole; done
  if [[ $(qubes-prefs default_netvm sys-firewall |grep sys-firewall ) ]]; then qubes-prefs default_netvm sys-pihole; fi
